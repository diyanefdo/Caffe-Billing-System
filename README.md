# Caffe-Billing-System
The Caffe Billing System was created using C# Windows forms with an interactive interface.
The program allows the cashiers to choose and insert the amount of each type of item bought by customers.
After the amounts have been inserted, the program calculates total considering the tax and service charge.
Finally, the program generataes a preview of the finalized receipt and allows the cashier to save or print the Bill.
